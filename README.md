This repository provides a way to upload an embedding model to SurrealDB and use a SurQL SQL function to calculate embeddings within the database. The primary goal is to enable in-database vector calculations and searches without the need to pre-calculate vectors.

Here's a breakdown of the repository's key components:

*   **Embedding Model Upload:** The repository is designed to allow you to upload a pre-trained embedding model into SurrealDB. The example provided uses a GloVe embedding model. You can download the GloVe model from [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), and a specific version of this model is available at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt).
*   **SQL Function Creation:** A SurrealQL function is created to generate embeddings from text using the uploaded model. This function, named `fn::sentence_to_vector`, can be called within SurrealDB queries.
    *   **Example Function Call:** `return fn::sentence_to_vector("this is a test");` would return a vector of float values.
    *   **Auto Embedding Generation**: The `fn::sentence_to_vector` function can calculate embedding vectors on-the-fly when inserting data into the database. Specifically, you can define a table with a `description` field and a `description_embedding` field, and the `description_embedding` field can be automatically populated with the output of the `fn::sentence_to_vector` function when new records are inserted. This is done by setting a default value on the field definition.

        Here's the example code demonstrating how to do this:

        ```sql
        DEFINE TABLE some_table TYPE NORMAL SCHEMAFULL;
        DEFINE FIELD description ON some_table TYPE option<string>;
        DEFINE FIELD description_embedding ON TABLE some_table TYPE option<array<float>>
        DEFAULT fn::sentence_to_vector(description) ;
        ```

        * **Explanation of the code:**

            **`DEFINE TABLE some_table TYPE NORMAL SCHEMAFULL;`**: This line defines a table named `some_table` with a normal and schemaless type. This indicates that the table's structure is flexible and can accommodate various data types, and schemas can be enforced as needed.
            **`DEFINE FIELD description ON some_table TYPE option<string>;`**: This line defines a field named `description` within the `some_table`. It specifies that this field will store an optional string value.
            **`DEFINE FIELD description_embedding ON TABLE some_table TYPE option<array<float>>`**: This defines a field named `description_embedding` within the `some_table`. It specifies that this field will store an optional array of float values representing the embedding vector.
            **`DEFAULT fn::sentence_to_vector(description);`**: This crucial part sets the **default value** for the `description_embedding` field. Whenever a new record is inserted into `some_table` and the `description_embedding` field is not explicitly set, the database will automatically calculate the vector embedding of the `description` field using the `fn::sentence_to_vector` function, and store this result in the `description_embedding` field.

            * **Key takeaways:**
                * The `DEFAULT` keyword enables the automatic population of the `description_embedding` field with the output of the `fn::sentence_to_vector` function whenever a record is inserted without an explicit `description_embedding` value.
                * This approach allows for on-the-fly generation of vector embeddings during data insertion, making it easier to perform semantic searches.
                * By defining a default value, the database handles embedding calculations automatically without needing external processes or applications.



      *   **Vector Search Function:** Here is an example of a `fn::vector_search` function that performs a semantic search directly within the database. This function takes an input string, calculates its embedding vector using `fn::sentence_to_vector`, and then performs a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) search within the database based on pre-calculated embeddings.

      * ```sql
        DEFINE FUNCTION OVERWRITE fn::vector_search($input_string: string) {
            #returns 5 results based on brute force vector search
            LET $vector_embedding = fn::sentence_to_vector($input_string);
            LET $semantic_results = (
                SELECT *, vector::distance::knn() as distance
                FROM some_table
                WHERE description_embedding <|5,EUCLIDEAN|> $vector_embedding
                ORDER BY distance
            );
            RETURN $semantic_results;
        };
        ```
      
      **Key components of the function:**
      
      *   **`DEFINE FUNCTION OVERWRITE fn::vector_search($input_string: string)`**: This defines a function named `fn::vector_search` that accepts a string as input.
      *   **`LET $vector_embedding = fn::sentence_to_vector($input_string);`**: This line calculates the embedding vector of the input string using the `fn::sentence_to_vector` function, and stores it in the variable `$vector_embedding`.
      *   **`LET $semantic_results = (... );`**: This defines a variable `$semantic_results` that will store the results of the KNN search.
      *   **`SELECT *, vector::distance::knn() as distance FROM some_table`**: This selects all fields from the `some_table` along with the calculated distance using the `vector::distance::knn()` function, and aliases that column as `distance`.
      *   **`WHERE description_embedding <|5|> $vector_embedding`**: This filters the records in `some_table` to find the 5 nearest neighbors based on the calculated `$vector_embedding` using the `<|5|>` operator, that represents a k-nearest-neighbors search.
      *   **`ORDER BY distance`**: This orders the results by the calculated distance.
      *   **`RETURN $semantic_results;`**: This returns the results of the semantic search.
      
      This function enables you to perform semantic searches directly within the database, without needing to pre-calculate the vector embeddings. This means that when you have a new input string, you can find similar records based on the embeddings of their description fields directly using this function, making your search functionality more dynamic.
